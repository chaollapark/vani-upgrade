<p>Just like the Synonym search, this search is aimed at the verse content of five main books that Srila Prabhupada gave us: Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Nectar of Instruction and Śrī Īśopaniṣad. To maximize the search speed, a database has been compiled, containing the verse lines, synonyms (English word by word translations) and a list of all individual words. So the searching is performed in the database and not in the Vanipedia pages, saving us from a lot of parsing complexity.</p> 
<p>Momentarily the search is confined to the English versions. So the hyperlinks in the resulting verse references are leading to English pages. Since more and more translations are appearing, it is our aim to also provide the possibility to select a specific language in the future.</p>
<p>The "Whole Words" option can be used to limit the result to those cases where the search query only matches  sequences of characters that are surrounded by so called word boundaries.</p>
<p>The "Diacritic Sensitive" option can be used to enforce an exact match with the words in the search query, regarding diacritic characters. If the option is not checked, a search term like <b>karuna</b> will match <b>karuṇa</b> and <b>karuṇā</b> and vice versa. If the option is checked, only exact matches are returned. Like the "Whole Words" option, this can be useful to limit the number of resulting verses.</p>
<p>A book filter is provided to limit the result to verses of a specific book.</p>
<p>The table with resulting verses can be sorted by any column: "Sanskrit or Bengali" or "Verse Reference". This can be done by making a choice in the "Sort By" drop-down list, or by clicking a specific column header.</p>
<p>You can enter a search query and then either click the Search button, or press Enter, to execute the search.</p>
<p>Preceding the search-query textbox, is a drop-down list with several operators that determine how the search query is applied. The following table shows each operator, together with its condition for success, and its possibility to be combined with the "Whole Words" option:</p>
