<p>This search is aimed at category names. Although a category can exist without a page, the Category search is confined to categories with a page. The title of such a page is always prefixed by the string "Category:". This namespace prefix should not occur in the search queries. Categories occur in one of the three main petals: Vanipedia, Vanisource or Vaniquotes. For each of these petals there is a checkbox by which the user can include or exclude that specific petal from the search.</p>
<p>Every category page is written in a certain language. A language filter is provided to limit the result to category pages of the selected language. Right after the namespace prefix, titles of non-English category pages have another prefix consisting of a language code followed by slash.</p>
<p>The "Whole Words" option can be used to limit the result to those cases where the search query only matches  sequences of characters that are surrounded by so called word boundaries.</p>
<p>You can enter a search query and then either click the Search button, or press Enter, to execute the search.</p>
<p>Preceding the search-query textbox, is a drop-down list with several operators that determine how the search query is applied. The following table shows each operator, together with its condition for success, and its possibility to be combined with the "Whole Words" option:</p>
